Run the Application:

Start the Express server: node server.js in the root directory.

Start the React app: npm start in the client directory.

This setup provides a simple example of fetching stock prices from a mock API every minute and displaying them using React for the frontend, Express/Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for storing stock data. And this is a basic implementation and can be extended and improved in various ways, such as error handling, styling, and more sophisticated data handling.
